All codes for basic machine learning concepts. This repo hosts the various codes that I learnt while exploring the vast and intriguing domain of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Any suggestion that enhances the features or performance of my model or even adds to my knowledge is highly praised. 

NOTE: None of the codes here are my own. All of them are from various different courses that I took to learn AI/ML.  

1. tf_classification: The code is same as that on freecodecamp.org website. It is done while I was learning about the TensorFlow Library. The dataset can be found at
